# NaughtsAndCrosses

A simple Naughts & Crosses (tic-tac-toe) game. My first program made using Elixir!

## Building & Running

To build the application, ensure you have Elixir installed. Then run the following command:

```mix escript.build```

And to run the application run

```./naughts_and_crosses```
